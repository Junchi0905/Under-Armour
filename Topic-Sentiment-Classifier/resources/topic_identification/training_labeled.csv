the people who own this place are super kind every single time i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in there.,,
has good foods and ingredients for anything you need!,,
my sister and i vacationed on orcas island a couple says.,,
i visited this sweet little grocery every day.,,
the ladies at the store got to know me because i went there every day.,,
i won't be back!,,
it's a tiny little convenient store but it has everything!,,
stop in here for sure.,,
if you live around here.,,
you can avoid a lot of trips to giant by stopping in for little items every house needs.,,
very lonely,,
i love the staff.,,
they have a pretty good variety offering of food and household essentials.,,
and they will stock items if you ask them to.,,
grew up going to this store almost daily.. just love this store n the owners..,,

not sure,,
rock.,,

gingerale.,,
this i observed across all aldi's in and around college park area.,,
i love aldi's stores around the us.,,
but this one was not my cup of tea.,,
rather than keep the place open under construction.,,
they should have just closed it.,,
no room to move.,,
barely any thing left at 11:00 on a sunday.,,
and lines that back up √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
awesome store with reasonable prices on their goods.,,
only problem is they sell shopping bags instead of giving it 2 the customer 4 free after buying items.,,
everything is good but due to the remodel.,,
the freezer section is limited and the aisles are much smaller.,,
i mean i get it.,,
you want to make money during the remodeling.,,
but for real.,,
there is so much construction that it's unbearable to shop here.,,
great price.,,
great selection.,,
you come out happy.,,
i don't like this aldi there is absolutely no diversity.,,
they look at you like you dont belong here.,,
i don't give company like that my money.,,
i dont feel welcomed!,,
excellent prices and customer sevices.you visited the place for one stuff and for the variety get more√∞√ø¬§¬£√∞√ø¬§¬£√∞√ø¬§¬£,,
this place runs hot an cold.,,
food is good seasonal goods and supplies leave something to be desired except around christmas,,
their customer service was excellent despite remodeling,,
great shopping experience with different brands in aldi.,,
i've found a lot of stuff that i like.,,
it's healthy and saving more.,,
love this fruit punch very much.,,
great for vegetables wish they had a salad bar,,
prices are good but you don't have the same variety as other stores,,
of all the aldi's that i have shopped at and i have shopped at almost everyone in the dmv  areas.,,
this is the most worst one that i have ever shopped in.,,
first of all.,,
as you enter the store there's a horrible smell.,,
there are 6 registers in the store.,,
buy at the most only 2 are ever open.,,
then i saw that one the registers was closing.,,
and almost every time i go there the cashiers spend to much time making small talk with the customers.,,
aldi has some really good deals.some items are unbeatable but other items are'nt as good and they cost more than the retails stores.,,
so therefore this review was'nt easy .,,
under remodeling it will get better,,
lines can get a little long sometimes but their prices pay off.,,
getting things like milk.,,
butter.,,
eggs.,,
frozen fruit...you can usually get a good deal.,,
also bought some christmas wrapping paper here.,,
a place filled with nice surprises.,,
the customer service is excellent,,
it's ok. not much variety and you have to pay for a shopping cart...,,
they carry a decent amount of vegetarian products.,,
it's like a small farms market experience!,,
my favorite grocery store by far.,,
i've been shopping here for quite some time.,,
highly recommended!!,,
best of best so far.,,
aldi is great this aldi is terrible.,,
super dirty.,,
rotting vegetables.,,
trash everywhere.,,
prices marked wrong.,,
often never has any of the items in the weekly ad.,,
people panhandling outside the store.,,
it is like shopping in a third world √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great supermarket.,,
wide variety of items.,,
very well price groceries at the moment the store is under construction still open,,
can't live without this store.,,
i am plant based.,,
a foodie and broke.,,
so i get most of my food supplies from an aldi's.,,
some aldi's are better than others.,,
i prefer the dc ne location.,,
absolutely love this market .,,
prices are great and better than a lot of other markets.,,
dont like how sometimes lines are just too long and 2 lanes are the only ones going .,,
but they have gotten better with that service .,,
great store!,,
good grocery and merchandise.,,
keep up the good job.,,
i have to give this aldi's a medium rating.,,
normally the stock is okay on occasion on a week to week basis.,,
but in particular this aldi's has issue with keeping meats in stock and produce seems to vary wildly to days where i can find red √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
inexpensive grocery store with rental shopping cart outside,,
almond milk ?,,
...got it from aldi !,,
excellent prices  by the way.,,
love it cheap and good,,
associates could be friendlyer.,,
they have good stuff for good prices.,,
not much name brand.,,
but just as good.,,
i go here for in between giant food stops for little stuff and coffee is super cheap for put it machines!,,
1/2 price of anywhere else,,
great selection and prices.,,
good prices and good food...,,
low prices.,,
very busy.,,
long lines.,,
no lines for people with few items.,,
get cussed at and called names when you ask about it.,,
really a horrible place.,,
don't ever go there,,
great prices √∞√ø‚Äò¬ç,,
excellent place to shop.,,
cheap items.,,
some good brands,,
was coo.,,
employees had a good attitude,,
pretty straightforward.,,
i've never had any issues when i shop at this location.,,
good place to shop okay customer service.,,
they have good prices and good food.,,
great shopping experience.,,
so after today i will not be doing any shopping from aldi.,,
my brother bought a box of oatmeal that contained the packets of instant oatmeal.,,
today as he opened one of the packets.,,
the ingredients started to crawl around the bowl.,,
yes that's √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
is a nice place to be therefore,,
cheap prices.,,
nice and cheap stuff,,
it is cheap and there is a lot of good thing that you can buy,,
bring your own bags and check your prices as some items are not price lower than others.,,
nice produce section!,,
love coming here!,,
prices are excellent.,,
this aldi does not sell wine.,,
very disappointed.,,
this is what i observed during a  conversation be ween a customer and  a security person in the store today at about 1:30pm.,,
i saw a security .,,
who dressed unprofessionally.,,
talking tocustomer who has kids in a very rude manner saying √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it was great,,
cheap and good,,
its not the same anymore go somewhere else to shop,,
they don't have dozens of choices for every product.,,
but they have the essentials at the lowest price to be found in this city.,,
there's stuff constantly spilled.,,
look could be updated.,,
i've been shopping at this location for 10 yrs.,,
now i love love this place.,,

when i told management all they said was go to another cashier.,,
they seem to have had everything i was looking for.,,
not many options and very small.,,
it depend which one you go to a lot food and stuff,,
did not have lettuce.,,
i shop here on a weekly basis.,,
the checkout line is super fast to go through as well.,,

turkey hill butter pecan ice cream at aldis√∞√øÀú≈°,,
for all my inexpensive food shopping,,
the best time to go would be on tuesdays.,,
between 9am-11am if you can because of how busy they get.,,
outside those times.,,
it's a stronger chance that you'll be in line for at least 5 minutes.,,
also.,,
don't forget to bring a quarter of you want to use their cart!,,
it was basic.,,
aldi is simply the best grocery store in the us.,,
thanks aldi!,,
the aldi in hyattsville is horrible!,,

very good grocery store,,
a great place to shop!,,
aldi is like giant and save a lot kind of they have produce they have meat they have snacks and etc.,,
they are a good food produce with low prices,,
i have never seen this in my life.,,
"the ""manager"".",,
stops this guy and stands in front of his cart.,,
she then demands that the guy put back the stuff in his cart because he took too much.,,
the guy asks her why can't you just order more.,,
a few √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it was a poor customer experience.,,
because they had only one cashier during a rush hour shopping.,,
i guess it's a recurring pattern in this location.,,
need more cashier's in light to abhor efficient and happy customer experience.,,
the store is great but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never not stood in line for at least 15 min.,,
never enough cashiers.,,
i know that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s how aldi works...but damn.,,
it is a deterrent from going all the time.,,
fast cashiers.,,
bring your own bags.,,
useful selection of household items and food.,,
i had a great experience at aldi's today.,,
i ended up getting far more than i planned!,,
√∞√øÀú¬ç,,
i love that store i suggest you go there you will be there all day if you are by yourself,,
i enjoy going to aldi's.,,
my only request is that they put a bench in their front store area for people that are waiting for a cab.,,
my car was in the shop and i needed to go to the store.,,
i didn't go there because i can't stand that long waiting for my cab to show up.,,
other then that this is a great store,,
aldi prices are very reasonable.,,
love the seasonal specials every week,,
i was born and raised in germany where aldi is from.,,
if you know what to expect.,,
like cheap shelving and displays.,,
you going to love the prices and the weekly deals.,,
lots of affordable organic items.,,
i get shocked at the prices.,,
its actually crazy.,,
friendly enough staff.,,
often disorganized and you can seldom find anything a second time.,,
it's a fine place to shop,,
normally love the place.,,
but in the spirit of improvement.,,
the checkout lines are incredibly long.,,
tonite it was 75 feet long.,,
no exaggeration.,,
only one cashier.,,
could not wait for the two dinner items i needed.,,
i went to aldi in del ray.,,
alexandria va. what a find!,,
huge.,,
incredibly delicious.,,
all organic.,,
fruits.,,
veggies.,,
wow!!!,,
i will have to check out the aldi in my town.,,
all sorts of berries.,,
huge saltines √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
this store is my new favorite in alexandria.,,
german brands not seen in other groceries.,,
and of course the bargains cannot be beat.,,
save money by bringing your own bags and bagging-it yourself.,,
these stores are a bit different than your normal suburban grocery - just takes a bit of time to understand the layout and no-frills process.,,
there's also a selection of other staples.,,
"my ""go to"" grocery store.",,
tempting special buys.,,
i visit a couple of times a week.,,
we go here weekly or bi weekly for the main essentials like apples.,,
potatoes.,,
spinach.,,
milk.,,
cheese.,,
bread.,,
breakfast bars.,,
frozen vegetables.,,
and oatmeal.,,
this location is convenient.,,
fast and helpful workers.,,
and good products.,,
i drive here over all of the other aldi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in the area!,,
they have a really great selection of almost everything- sometimes produce can be lacking if you go when they haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t restocked (like late on the weekends).,,
but overall its a great aldi.,,
prices can't be beat!,,
literally cut my grocery bill in half by shopping here.,,
not a whole lot of name brand items.,,
make sure to bring your own bags.,,
and a quarter if you need a shopping cart (you get it back at the end),,
a discount supermarket with all the basic necessities but not the other special items that are in major name markets.,,
the produce section is very large.,,
good prices on certain items but overall.,,
their prices are comparable to any other grocery store.,,
the only difference is that they run weekly prices that can run week after week.,,
it's a small store with limited choices (couldn't find √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i love aldi in general.,,
this aldi in particular is good.,,
excellent prices decent food selection.,,
better bring your own bag or buy them for a dime each.,,
a 25 cent quarter is needed to get a carriage.,,
but it's refunded back to you.,,
large variety of food.,,
a lot of organic options.,,
and reasonably priced.,,
if you've never been to aldi bring a quarter for the carts (you get it back when you return the cart) and bags.,,
great location.,,
not so in the selection and the layout of the store.,,
i had to go around the store a few times and still couldn't find what i was looking for.,,
standard store.,,
remember a quarter for the vast and your reusable shopping bags.,,
i would give zero stars if it were possible!,,
the staff at this location are some of the rudest people i have ever encountered.,,
i stood in line (waited quite a long while).,,
and when i got to the cashier i asked him if he would please check √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great aldi to do your shopping at just have a quarter for the cart.,,
dear aldi managenent at e monroe.,,
we wish you could add tofu.,,
coconut milk without sugar and a2 milk in your list of product!,,
we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to go to other grocery stores to get them and shop there at the same time.,,
you guys are great!,,
love your grocery store!!!,,
simple and all we need are there.,,
thank you!,,
amazing prices.,,
what's not to love?,,
relatively locally sourced daily restocked produce.,,
organic aldi-brand products not advertised commercially.,,
we do the majority of our shopping here.,,
while you have to double-check the produce.,,
we can usually find whatever we need at a great value.,,
they even have wild-caught fish for a cheap price.,,
the cashiers are friendly and the store provides chairs so they don't have to stand.,,
just remember to bring a quarter for the cart!,,
helpful staff.,,
can't miss!,,
i paid half of what i would have at other stores.,,
fast check out service... bring your own bags!,,
was there the day before the holiday and couldn't find certain items.,,
larger than my usual aldi's in detroit.,,
image it's a great store earlier in the day!,,
excellent prices,,
excellent i like,,
phenomenal product line and prices.,,
best place to shop.,,
can't beat the price.,,
reasonably priced,,
now have verity of organic vegetables with affordable prices,,
nice store.,,
glad they have public restrooms.,,
fast cashiers and friendly service.,,
it's an aldi.,,
but if you haven't been to one before.,,
know that the prices are insanely cheap.,,
you need a quarter to use a cart (you get it back when you return it).,,
and you need to bring your own bags.,,
located in a nice part of town,,
great grocery store in the area.,,
they have great prices.,,
and variety.,,
i enjoy shopping here.,,
be sure to remember to bring a quarter to use the carts and bags to put your groceries in after check out!,,
organic and specialty is very vreat,,
great product selection and friendly staff.,,
aldi is great.,,
cheap good stuff.,,
no noisy music.,,
simple clear prices.,,
lots less expensive than tj and harris teeter but wine selection not as good but very affordable.,,
superb and most affordable.,,
i will drop.in ever so often.,,
aldi has great prices and is definitely worth the trip.,,
it has a limited selection.,,
so i still need to grocery shop elsewhere for specific items.,,
it's ross for food.,,
cheap finds.,,
but you really have to look.,,
cant complain about anything.,,
you get cheap food!,,
you have to pay a quarter to use a cart but you get the quarter back and you have to pay for bags so i suggest bringing your own.,,
its a new concept for some but in the end if youre shopping on a budget its a great place to go!,,
even better prices!,,
cash registers adequately staffed.,,
look for excellent german frozen products -- like bremers.,,
the spatzel and their shepherd pie is fantastic.,,
also great pesto sauce.,,
lemon pound cake.,,
and different types of hummus.,,
i love aldi.,,
you never know what you'll find that's new and at a great price.,,
i used to shop aldi when i lived 8 years in europe (amsterdam and rotterdam).,,
there's a little leaning curve: bring a quarter for the cart (you'll get it back) √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine.,,
sure.,,
there are deals.,,
but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really get the hype √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù maybe because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like to make multiple stops.,,
produce is a better deal than trader joe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s but otherwise it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just ok.,,
poor customer service,,
it's just a good overviewed store and because i'm german and it's actually a german store.,,
it feels kinda home.,,
respect their cart quarter system and bring-your-own-bag approach.,,
they have some uncommon items as well as cheap produce.,,
i finally found the peanut puffs that i love here.,,
they also have generic version of known food items.,,
bring your bags and a quarter for the shopping cart.,,
watch for the sale items in the mail.,,
aldi is a great place for the right amount of food at a good price.,,
friendly people.,,
probably one of the more awesome aldis i've been to .still wish they had little more selection in the toiletries and medicine idles lol,,
aldi s relatively new here.,,
much appreciated aldi!,,
fantastic cheap and good groceries!,,
most packaged goods are generic.,,
the best part is the prices are substantially lower than their competitors.,,
what's not to like!,,
favorite grocery store in town.,,
to give you an idea.,,
eggs cost from 69 cents to $1.19!,,
on average.,,
you can expect to pay at least $1 less on the items you would get at the other local stores like giant or harris teeter.,,
they run a lot like √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s normally expected.,,
but sometimes it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stuff like √∞√ø≈ì¬∂ peppers.,,
employees are cognisent of customer needs and willing to find out information about products.,,
very good prices for what you get.,,
as an added bonus.,,
great if you aren't too picky and want to save some money.,,
loved it,,
i love this aldi - loads of great options for amazing prices.,,
they have an awesome variety of cheese.,,
and you can find a good amount of staples.,,
aldi doesn't carry everything.,,
but it's a great store for the basics.,,
this is the best aldi i've ever been to.,,
the staff is also really polite,,
great newer location.,,
pretty solid beer and wine selection and very easy to get in and out.,,
most regularly stocked items were available and their special finds selection last week were outstanding.,,
where else can you find of a wedge of √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
some items were not priced & the cherries that were on sale were out of stock.,,
i love this place!,,
the staff is friendly and fast!,,
especially if you're looking for a specialty ingredient.,,
but √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
they do not have a ton of variety.,,
but nearly everything they do have is worth getting.,,
also the staff are all extremely friendly.,,
excellent groceries with proper portion sizes and great prices.,,
no frills.,,
wide aisles.,,
and excellent selection of breads.,,
cheeses.,,
fruits etc,,
very low prices.,,
and a surprising selection.,,
but you have to know that there's a reason that the process are so low.,,
i just don't happen to mind any of the areas that they skimp on.,,
very european.,,
maybe it was all the unfamiliar brands being offered there.,,
friendly workers.,,
bring a quarter for the shopping cart rental.,,
easy access.,,
great food and prices.,,
the selection is streamlined to aldi brands.,,
but i think these are very good.,,
i admit.,,
the poorer cousin of supermarkets.,,
great selection and prices,,
i have a great experience.,,
poor beer selection.not a lot of variety in general.,,
covers basic grocery needs.,,
i recommend coming anytime other than primetime (evenings) since usually only three or fewer checkout lines are staffed.,,
some great prices but take your own bags!,,
great prices and a decent selection.,,
with fewer brands they are able to keep costs down which makes everything cheaper.,,
1st aldi experience was awful.,,
but wasn't this store.,,
i love shopping here.,,
groceries for a family of 4 just $75 a week!,,
can't touch that at giant.,,
safeway or anywhere else.,,
and the basics.,,
they don't have some things.,,
but i can grab those specific items from somewhere else when needed.,,
this interesting supermarket has a very foreign feel.,,
it's shelves are stocked in the shipping boxes.,,
carts are 25 cents.,,
and you have to pay for bags.,,
but it has surprising finds.,,
like ties.,,
as well as competitive prices.,,
love the prices and neat stuff on weekly basis.,,
hesitate to rate it because i love it so much i wish i could keep it a secret.,,
this is a great aldi.,,
:),,
my go to store.,,
they have a few selection when it comes to greens.,,
i consider this place as something to go to when i forget something at a big grocery chain.,,
you have to remember what they have so you don't disappoint yourself in going here and then finding out that they don't have it.,,
it's true that this is a really cheap place.,,
this company is changing it look for the better..i like it!,,
prices are great.,,
staff are harried but helpful.,,
go at the right time of day looking for basics and you're well served.,,
wrong time of day the place is a zoo.,,
great selection and very fast check-out; with a sense of urgency!,,
it's aldi - no frills.,,
pay attention to entrance.,,
i didn't realize it until i jammed traffic going the wrong way.,,
i'm not used to aldi.,,
i was happy with selection and prices.,,
i shop at aldi during business travel.,,
i find their √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
long long line.,,
one cashier.,,
great produce section!,,
beer and wine is a very good value as well.,,
love most of the products.,,
.,,
most people i run in to have the same complaint i do.,,
i think that's poor management.,,
great shop.,,
kind and helpful staff.,,
i love the service.,,
communication.,,
and professionalism.,,
i was doing some shopping.,,
having a good time enjoying myself.,,
i get so many things from this shopping center.,,
it's very convenient and a good variety of services.,,
it's amazing how you can fill up your cart for a surprising amount of money.,,
i recommend this store,,
for a while they had top of the tater.,,
but now they don't.,,
still good cheap place to shop,,
great produce and prices.,,
i am a very happy customer.,,
this is consistently a great location when it comes to the staff.,,
there are out of stocks occasionally.,,
but that is the norm in the grocery business as margins become thinner and √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i really liked this aldi grocery store.,,
i am so looking forward to coming back and doing my shopping here.,,
i'm glad to know that there is one in virginia that is close to me.,,
the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.,,
they went out of √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i was very disappointed in this store due to a lack of organic product.,,
no organic bread.,,
flour or butter.,,
the prices were good but if i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get organic basics i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see myself as a regular shopper,,
prices are good.,,
basic presentation of product.,,
minimal assistance.,,
prices are much better than competitors.,,
store needs updating.,,
adequate pricing.,,
mostly inhouse brands.,,
very courteous stockers,,
specious.,,
reasonably priced supermarket.,,
there was bathroom too.,,
the only thing that seems strange to me was that it i had to have a coin to unlock the cart which seemed reasonable since i didn't see any carts laying around making the place untidy.,,
instead i used one of the cardboards from the store as a container.,,
food at aldi is normally good.,,
tomatoes.,,
rotten apples.,,
and unsealed food this is the place for you.,,
the employees are also rude as well.,,
they all seem to hate their jobs and yell √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i usually shop here every week or two.,,
the store is run very efficiently.,,
over time.,,
i have learned to avoid a few of their products such as paper towels and √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it is a good market with qaulity products and good customer service.,,
it the hope for fair marketing and good competition.,,
really good experience... the high light of my trip is that they sell wine..   1 stop shop!,,
i had not heard the credit card system was down.,,
i get through the line and hear it is cash only.,,
i apologize and turn to leave when lawerence said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìoh no i got you sir.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù  he proceeded to take cash out of his own wallet.,,
he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
busy location same great prices,,
we do all of most of the shopping for our family here because prices are incredible.,,
vagrants at the door a bit too often.,,
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find everything you need for great price!,,
enjoy shopping,,
german supermarket chain extension in us.,,
oneay need 25 cents for unlock cart.,,
long waiting lines on sunday around 3 pm are handled with speed and courtesy.,,
will be baaack,,
aldi's is the best.,,
why over pay for organic fruits and vegetables when you can get them here for the same price as regular.,,
most people don't realize aldi's is more or less a no-frills trader joes.,,
i like it.,,
because prices are good and also its product are good specially  the price of sugar.,,
oil.any kind of  sauce and other things.every things is good.,,

this is one of the best aldi's i've been to in a long time.,,
even better than the one where i live in maryland.,,
every shelf was full and organized and the people.,,
staff was really nice and helpful.,,
as well as customers too,,
no irish  butter for last many weeks.,,
otherwise  good  store,,
good values nice selection,,
some of the cheapest groceries.,,
on a good day eggs will be as low as 79√¢¬¢ .,,
they limit 6 per customer.,,
one of the best stores.,,
good selection and variety of food.,,

every day fair price.,,
the store has some great deals and the employees are friendly.,,
pleasant customers service.,,
good place.,,
nice customer service.,,
they have less items than big grocery shops but they definitely have the essentials.,,
what matters the most is you can't beat the prices at aldi.,,
love the prices and variety at aldi's.,,
the best aldi in the area: kinda understaffed at time/hard find people working in this affluent area.,,
but the employees tried their best and customer service.,,
food staples and discounts are much better than the other franchise in the area.,,
keep up the good work!,,
affordable.,,
lot of options.,,
great place to save money.,,
they do have organic options as well.,,
you can't beat the prices.,,
i wouldn't have been able to survive unemployment if it wasn't for aldi!,,
i love this store.,,
i am a client of aldi and i like to shop there.,,
several times when i shopping.,,
the cashier literally throws the products into my shopping cart.,,
several times i made a note.,,
but there was no improvement.,,
last time even the cashier  overcharged my bill.,,
i am very disappointed.,,
best prices in the area and great products.,,
but limited variety.,,
exelent√¢¬°!√¢¬°,,
plenty of cashiers.,,
another  good place to shop,,
love this place and their prices!,,
this is a conveniently located aldi off of i-95 and seminary road in alexandria.,,
it is a fairly large aldi.,,

friendly workers and found everything i needed fast.,,
was in and out in 20 minutes!,,
great prices!,,
make sure to bring a quarter if you want to use a cart.,,
but variety is limited.,,
well aldi will make you have flashbacks.,,
products sold from inside packing boxes.,,
no perishable foods.,,
am not writing this as √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great bargains!,,
so it is good to buy it without worry,,
ok price kinda messy,,
i love this place,,
now accepting credit cards.,,
you need a quarter to get a cart.,,
the prices are lower.,,
but it is less convenient.,,
overall.,,
worth the savings.,,
only one variety of a given grocery.,,
you have to bag your own √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
only been here once.,,
but really good value with decent selection of food.,,
store organization takes getting used to and food is still in boxes on shelves.,,
would recommend if you don't need things pretty like whole foods.,,
they have organic milk.,,
?,,
first time visiting an aldi and i can't wait for them to show up on my area.,,
the store was well stocked and neatly arranged.,,
the prices were unbelievably low where it seems i paid half of what i would havee at other supermarkets.,,
while lines were long.,,
the cashiers were efficient in moving the queue.,,
the food is great and the prices are fantastic!,,
this is a no-frills supermarket.,,
but that works just fine for me!,,
every time i check out i am shocked at how much i save over big name grocery stores.,,
i have been doing 98% of my shopping √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i had a very nice experience.,,
i took my service dog and everyone was very nice and friendly.,,
reasonable,,

but it still a great store.,,
i love shopping at aldi.,,
for years i shopped at other stores and did know what i was missing.,,
every sunday i have a date with aldi.,,
organic selections.,,
gluten free products.,,
fruits and a wide variety more.,,
i highly recommend √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
aldi's is a great place to shop if you are looking for a bargain to save money.,,
be forewarned.,,
good shopping experience... have alot of cereal alternatives.,,
can be pretty busy on certain days.,,
but they get you through the line pretty fast,,
it isn't a big store but they have a unique approach to keeping cost down.,,
they don't have normal isles with lots of shelves.,,

you can't get milk cheaper anywhere else in the area.,,
so just swing by aldi and you'll thank me.,,
aldi provides good selection and great value.,,
do you know how hard it is for me to give an aldi 4 stars????,,
it's because this one here in langley/takoma park is so popular they sell out of basics sometimes.,,
love aldi for big cheap pantry shops.,,
the chocolate.,,
the ease of whizzing √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
nice staff.,,
great products.,,

it's the greatest and cheapest place i've ever been.,,
i bought so many things and i was frightened at the idea of going over my budget for the week but surprisingly.,,
i had not even exceeded 100 dollars.,,
the cashier who served me was really friendly and fast.,,
highly recommend it.,,
good food variety.,,
preiswert  local products.,,
"german chocolate  helps to ""stretch the buck"" ....",,
they have the best prices.,,
they have generic store brand versions of popular products but it tastes about the same as the named brands except the prices are cheaper.,,
this location is dirty.,,
disorganized.,,
and full of immigrants who do not respect or appreciate the courtesy of waiting their turn in line or returning perishable items back to the refrigerator.,,
or not opening products that they haven't √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
aldi is the perfect place for shopping foods.,,
it's reasonable and fair to buy from there.,,
the most part is customers satisfaction.,,
i love how the prices are much lower but realize the reason for that is because lots of big brands of food aren't here.,,
i wish there was more diversity but for the prices it is expected,,
busy store but very accessible.,,
close by other major stores.,,
bus stop right at the front.,,
good selections and great prices.,,
its a good place to buy food and its really cheap,,
staff here is amazing.,,

needs help.,,
i shop at aldi wherever i go and also weekly at home in florida.,,
this store (my first visit) needs attention.,,
it's sloppy and understocked.,,
especially the freezers.,,
boxes everywhere.,,
i wasn't feeling the aldi love.,,
but will not be back to this store in particular.,,
i was searching for the pineapple salsa.,,
because they have different kinds mixed together.,,
you have to move the boxes to get kind you want if its not on top.,,
so that is what i √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it's okay.,,
haven't tried much yet.,,
missing one item they usually have in stock,,
not friendly!!,,
i just go there for the low prices.,,
some of the staff.,,
rude!,,
i am thinking of one particular person...i wonder if he knows that i work very hard for my salary?...i do retail so customer service isn't an option.,,
it's a must!,,
combination of no-name brands and volume purchasing results in low prices,,
good cuality,,
is the best store i ever bought for my kitchen,,
according to the news snow is headed our way.,,
so with the little money i had.,,
i went to ali's and got everything i needed.,,
i picked up grapes.,,
strawberries.,,
pineapple and salad fixings.,,
nice place to pit stop but very expensive.,,
i love shopping here !!,,
cheap prices compared to other popular stores.,,
you might not get all items you may be looking.,,
there are long lines every time i visit the store.,,
there are idle registers the store can use to reduce lengthy lines if they hire more cashiers.,,
staff are amazing.,,
store was pretty well stocked.,,
great prices for food,,
fast and efficient so much so the crowd was hardly noticed as a result.,,
great prices and a lot of good stuff.,,
i like their german foods.,,
one of the reasons there are such great prices is they save on shoplifting related expenses.,,
you'll go to hell if you're stealing from them (it's so cheap),,
awsome,,
went into new hampshire ave. hyattsville.,,
md store approx 5 pm.,,
usually shop mornings (the young women are busy.,,
polite to friendly).,,
male employee was removing empty boxes from shelves and cases.,,
i noticed this because his movements and √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great deal for fruits and produce.,,
the shopping experience was just ok this visit.,,
point of warning get there early or risk them being out of things later in the day.,,
today they were out of eggs.,,
love aldi the store stays stocked up on everything i need.,,
being a quarter for the shopping cart.,,
though,,
best place very chip's,,
disorganized no chicken noodle soup???,,
who doesn't have chicken noodle soup come on√∞√øÀú‚Ä∫√∞√øÀú¬£.,,
store dirty.,,
lines weren't long but took a long time to get thru.,,
no bags for people who forgot theirs.,,
very disappointing,,
cheap food!,,
aldi is very cheap,,
very convenient,,
cheaper prices,,
good price,,
friendly and helpful.,,
great service.,,
this store is excellent with prices.,,
certain items you should get early- they will sell out!,,
older location in chain.,,
customers are rough on this store.,,
a lot of put backs.,,
seems hard for staff to keep up.,,
good on the wallet nonetheless√¢Àú¬∫,,
workers not customer service.,,
beautiful i like what they did to the place love it,,
"every week i visit aldi
because they sell some staff
good price",,
junky!,,
neat.,,
full shelves and pleasant customers and employees.,,
a lot of choices when it comes to products comparing to other aldi locations.,,
the worst one i've ever been too.,,
and i've been to many of them.,,
went on a sunday night.,,
no variety.,,
i even saw packets of ginger rotting in black fungus.,,
didn't see pita bread anywhere.,,
they should make a mega aldi for this location.,,
the space is to small for the amount of folks that buy.,,
didn't have what i was looking for.,,
it's really an awesome grocery store.,,
their merchandise are reasonably priced.,,
good prices and cashiers are fast!,,
wonderful stock and great prices.,,
accessible and convenient public transportation.,,
near many mom and pop shops.,,
i loved it because they gave it an upgrade and it looks awesome.,,
it is also very organized.,,
don't expect much during christmas season because people love it so much and there is barely anything left.,,
substantial savings.,,
bring your own bags!,,
they have great prices on organic and regular food.,,
baby supplies and food.,,
and home and seasonal goods (tents.,,
lawn furniture.,,
swim suits.,,
kids toys.,,
kids wagons.,,
cooking items.,,
etc).,,
but their food selection is smaller than a regular grocery store.,,
they don't bag your groceries.,,
and the lines can be  long.,,
has good produce prices.,,
this one i usually really.,,
busy.,,
pro tip: avoid the entrance by the car wash of your driving and the weather nice.,,
great variety of food offerings and hard to beat prices.,,
the store would benefit from improved shelving and displays,,
limited selection for a grocery store.,,
staff friendly and helpful.,,
the store is extremely messy,,
great place!,,
but when though the county doesn't charge you for bags.,,
this place will.,,
plus you bag your own groceries.,,
boxes are provided.,,
like a club store.,,
but you gotta search for those.,,
only reason i have i didn't give √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
somewhat long check out lines.,,
but clerks are efficient.,,
as they have none.,,
(you can purchase a sturdy.,,
reusable bag for $2.),,
bring a refundable quarter to use a shopping cart.,,
pleasant cashier.,,
easy anf fast checkout.,,
i liked that place.,,
very cool.,,
abordable prices.,,
long lines and rude customer service,,
if in store security fixes this issue i'd be extremely happy to shop here.,,
but until then i'm seeking a different location.,,
the great prices.,,
average selection.,,
someone cut the line the cashier lady told him.,,
please get in line first came service.,,
i like this policy the employee in force the policy i love it.,,
i had a horrible experience  in that store this morning !!!,,
and it is not the first time !,,
prices are rarely clearly indicated.,,
especially in the fruit/ vegetable part of the store.,,
this is unacceptable !,,
and then.,,
arriving at the cash √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
best prices.,,
fast check out.,,
bring a quarter for the cart.,,
and your own grocery bags.,,
aldi is cheap and you can buy most of your everyday grocery.,,
i liked this place and shopped a lot.,,
no halal meat.,,
you need a 25-cent coin to use the cart.,,
one of the best place to deliver to.,,
got a door immediately and empty within 20-30 mins.,,
they want you to slide your trailer tandems.,,
chock your wheel and stay by you door.,,
i love aldi's!,,
this store is often problematic.,,
they frequently run out of popular items.,,
and the checkout lines are often noticeably longer than other locations.,,
but i guess that's how they are able to keep those low prices.,,
i've √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
definitely deserves 3 stars.,,
the appearance needs work.and the organization of the store needs work as well.,,
i went in with the intentions on buying dinner for the night.but was turned off by the customer service and appearance of product.,,
safeway is not that far away,,
but i am not a fan of this location.,,
i only stopped because it was on my way home.,,
as usual.,,
the produce section was a mess and barely had anything in stock.,,
this location also sells beer and wine and like the produce.,,
but.,,
they are so friendly here and alot of diversity.,,
the one by my house makes me feel unwelcome.,,
even the security guard here is nice.,,
i will be returning!,,
great deal.,,
cheese are great.,,
meat price is nowadays getting competitive which is good.,,
this is why i prefer the aldi in virginia.,,
they were out of things today on the last day of the sale.,,
and you cannot get them if they do not have them because they do not have rain checks.,,
so there were several things i wanted to get √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i was hoping to find multi packs of their energy shots.,,
singles only but a great price@99c ea.,,
one of the best aldi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ive ever been in.,,
decent wine and their selection of organic items is very impressive.,,
the prices are great and they have more than just food.,,
i love shopping at aldi's to get my basic groceries and checking out the aisle with household & other random stuff.,,
good place to shop for your buck.,,
a little skeptical about the meats but my husband seems to do very well when he shops here.,,
excellent prices.,,
very nice security cards and cashiers.,,
only problem is they need more carts.,,
if you dont mind bagging your own groceries.,,
it is definitely worth the trip.,,
has a lot of the stuff you need.,,
great prices and variety of different cheeses.,,
fruits and vegetables.,,
great place.,,
convenient shopping.,,
truly fits the everyday budget...,,
the aldi near me has gone down rotten vegetables and it smells of trash outside just to name a few things.,,
i'm very dissatisfied with the forestville location.,,
great customer service but their gala apples used to be really sweet and crispy but not anymore.,,
lots of rotted out apples in the bag lately and they tasted like nothing.,,
there's no option to buy individual gala apples so you can feel what you are buying and they steadily went up on the price.,,
i love the prices but some things i wish they carry them i wouldn't have to run over to safeway.,,
is some smoke neckbones to season my greens and cabbage and trukey hills french vanilla ice cream but others wise i love shopping there.being since they open.,,
best grocery shopping savings i've encountered thus far.,,
every month on the month.,,
professional.,,
just awesome!,,
i just love this store.,,
i feel good when i feed my kids down to the snacks.,,
the variety of items they sell down to paying .25 for your cart and get it refunded when you return it.,,
great business.,,
for this aldi to be in dc they keep inventory & they keep it in rotation.,,
i see products here i haven't seen at another aldi.,,
nice cashiers.,,
decent selection at great prices.,,
surprising amount of vegetarian options.,,
gourmet options.,,
and kosher options.,,
great prices and staff.,,
i especially enjoy the food made in germany.,,
aldi is great grocery shopping choice.,,
many of their products are comparable.,,
if not better than.,,
safeway.,,
giant and shopper's but much better prices.,,
i shop at aldi's all the time great prices and good customer service,,
it was ok. didn't have to many of the things i need.,,
and was kind of smelly in there.,,
prices are good food is decent but there's never enough cashiers working,,
plus the services is awesome .,,
their specially selected and simply nature brands are limited time.,,
so buy what you want now.,,
lines can get crazy long though.,,
thats my favorite store to shop at......√∞√øÀúÀú√∞√øÀúÀú√∞√ø‚Äô‚Äì√∞√ø≈ì‚Ä°,,

"fda food recall alert√∞√ø‚Äù¬•the food and drug administration is  recalling  a number of products from aldi's supermarket chain because of ecoli(pop)contamination and metal found in:""bakers corner all-purpose flour .red meat:steaks.ribs& brisket& √¢‚Ç¨¬¶",,
i need info on getting hired.,,
the phones aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t working !,,
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already filled out an application.,,
i haven't been to aldi since last year.,,
it's an okay place .,,
good discounts on food.,,
i prefer to buy canned or bottled food like salad dressing.,,
mustard.,,
ketchup.,,
neither does the meat.,,
love the one in hechinger mall.,,
good selection of items.,,
saved allot of money,,
very poor customer service shift manager was very rude.,,
unprofessional mangers on duty.,,
workers complaining of the same ill treatment.,,
the staff was courteous where management was not.,,
they should promote one of those hard-working staff √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great option instead of walmart just moved out here looks like a brand new store.,,
was really glad to aldi in dc,,
and all the employees smile have order and very helpful.,,
five stars,,
my go-to place for groceries before giant or safeway.,,
inexpensive finds.,,
but don't forget to bring a quarter to rent a cart.,,
my favorite grocery store they ran out of fruit at this one not good,,
efficient.,,
would recommend and return.,,
√∞√ø‚Äò¬ç√∞√ø¬è¬æ,,
i found these delicious cookies once and have never found them again.,,
but ill never stop looking.,,
its a great place to go shopping,,
what am i go to grocery stores and the selection it's beyond great pricing on vegetarian meals are my favorite,,
i love the produce section,,
this aldi is dirty and the regional manager is rude.,,

limited cashiers,,
when your budget is low you can go there and shop and be happy at the end,,
great price to value.,,

employees should not be running floor machinery while customers are shopping nor should employees be stocking while blocking passage of customers.,,

some good items but not a place i would do all my grocery shopping,,
save a lot is good for big families.. i just hope it stays that way..,,
my favorite location.,,
ghetto,,
has few good items in produce you can buy,,
cheap prices more for your money,,
great bargains,,
they have everything a safeway has except for name brand items,,
has all your basic necessities.,,
you can find some good deals in here as well.,,
there is a lot of off brand things but they do have some name brands.,,
some are just as good as the name brand if not better.,,
they generally only have 1 or 2 cashier's working though so sometimes the lines can get back up,,
nice variety of choices at a great value price.,,
very good prices on certain things...,,
it's a small place some items are really good prices and mostly produce is good price to shop here.,,
it is a discount food store.,,
and that's exactly what you do in there you save a lot but you buy a lot they have all sorts of stuff in that even furniture house with home with speakers all kind of stuff going to check it out,,
but the customer service is kinda like they don't like their jobs and they're only doing it for the paycheck.,,

the store manager micheal is rude and very unprofessional.,,
the managers has no respect for the customers shopping.,,
it good supermarket.,,
it has different kinds of foodstuffs.,,
lashawn my cashier was very pleasant.,,
i like going through her line.,,
the meat guys are the best and keep it fully stocked.,,

pushed my car away.,,
and so on.,,
great prices for groceries.,,
but that can be expected considering how much one paid.,,
i love the prices for meats and products.,,
a great place to shop.if you're on a fixed income.,,
produce is inexpensive.,,
love this store.,,
i go outta my way just 2 go here.,,

mostly an affordable selection of off-brand packaged foods.,,
small produce selection.,,
inventory can be inconsistent.,,
but the basics are usually available.,,
otherwise great for basic needs,,

good prices !,,
fast and have what you want.,,
even on a busy saturday.,,
on 7/27/19 all of the lemons had a dirty green coating.,,
sorry i did not take a photo.,,
aldi's down the street is way better.,,
the meats didn't look good either.,,
good prices on a wide selection of items,,
very good experience,,
fast check out,,
u can get food and household items if working on an buget,,
there hasn't been but one time that i couldn't find what i needed,,
the prices on most items are fair but they don't have many name brand foods so it's difficult to tell what tastes good.,,
i have enjoyed the off brand spaghetti sauce.,,
it is much better than the big name sauce and it is only $1 per jar.,,
the cases of water is priced right as well.,,
i love to shop there price is right employees  are so nice love this store is so close to home thank you for being  here,,
i found all i need perfect and cheap price than expected,,
love here,,
it's ok to shop at this store,,
prices on produce is some times good.,,
the staffirst is courteous.,,
long lines but okay,,
very friendly.,,
and practical.,,
they had basically what we needed.,,
not to many people cheap prices,,
best prices in the town,,
good people working hard very friendly,,
the store has decent prices.,,
it's just that  the products that are on sale are not reflected in the system on a consistent basis.,,
so make sure to check your receipt for items that are on sale.,,
decent...affordable....convenient......,,
save-a-lot is a scaled down grocery chain.,,
great bargains on brand named products.,,
had some good looking t-bone steaks on sale.,,
it's one associate in there that i fogot her name.,,
but she been in that store for awhile and she's just so friendly,,
place was organized ok. there were only 2 cashiers at 5pm or so.,,
the lines were long.,,
meats are dated.,,
we shop and shop we save as we go along but the different are we know what store will give u spare change u can save i had two food carlton i shop like my late mother bless her heart she will shop like she can.t stop i said mom it's only √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i love the price,,
excellent savings,,
its alright but aldi's is way more cheaper .,,
like shopping with them,,
cheap steaks,,
i love this chain for their products and prices.,,
convenient location,,
save-a-lot does exactly what the name tells you you're doing!,,
inexpensive grocery store,,
the store need a lot repair/work done.,,
i did not buy anything from this store.,,
the store can use better management and more works as well.,,
i love save a lot because they have good customer service and good food,,
i guess is fine but make sure to get small bags of all the chips,,
a lot of the times in this store everything goes by fast and easy.,,
sometimes they're understaffed and the lines get congested.,,
aside from that.,,
the service and products are good and well priced.,,
i love save a lot because they give a lot.,,
and you save a lot!,,
it was an inconvenience to pay cash for my groceries  because the register system was not working.,,
also a good place to shop.,,
prices are great√∞√øÀú≈æ√∞√øÀú≈æ,,
v nice customer service and cheap prices,,
i asked to speak to a manager about cashier rudeness in rushing me through the line by grabbing and pulling my cart to the front of the desk before i could get the item out of the cart.,,
when i asked him not to do that he said it was store √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i like savealot .,,
"prices are reasonable i also like variety of root vegetables and cuts of meats
 available",,
good location,,
this is an excellent store where you can buy several things at lower prices than other grocery stores.,,
there is a growing amount of latino and other ethnic foods.,,
my only complaint is that the lines can get a little long.,,
the environmental is the problem but good store to maximize your money,,
their prices are awesome!,,
they are friendly and do have name brand items!,,
produce could use some help but since i don't live closer to aldi i'll take what i can get for the price!,,
friendly associate's and very convenient location.,,
this is the best save a lot that i have seen.,,
store merchandise layout is guiding you.,,
store layout poor.,,
i love this particular location because they are generally well stocked,,
the store was not appealing at all.,,
thought i was in ghetto city.,,
a dump...,,
the cashier was not friendly at all.,,
and she didn't know a cucumber from a squash.,,
charged me $1.49/lb instead of.,,
99 each.,,
i asked for a manager and the manager took more than 5mins to show up for my refund and i just left.,,
good pricing and you really save a lot.,,
inexpensive store no name brand items grocery's,,
i only shop here for certain items or as a last minute meal idea.,,
the cashiers are fast.,,
which is great because i absolutely hate long lines.,,
good for groceries for family shopping.,,
good store to go to if you don't have much money .,,
sometimes they have good deals .,,
i shop here regularly.,,
friendly cashiers and great prices!,,
cute little market.,,
the security guy was so friendly!,,
wasn't dissapointed.,,
prices are reasonable.,,
check your savings!,,
they are true.,,
√∞√ø‚Äò‚Äö cheap items at all level!,,
so their hours say they're open until 9:30 pm but i just walked up to the door and the employee told me they were closed.,,
their doors were locked and everything.,,
mind you it was 9:10pm.,,
will be calling the store tomorrow.,,
great place to buy latin products,,
rude staff.,,
filthy store.,,
a store full of people and two people ringing items.,,
"you can see through the fake tinted glass ""managers"" (stressing more than two managers) pilled into the tiny office when the store is in need of attention!",,
a shame!!!,,
but staff was courteous.,,
a very nice food shop.,,
prices are very moderate but goods are decent anyway.,,
recommended.,,
the only minus - there is no beer there (as well as any alcohol).,,
they only really cater to the hispanic race,,
use to be my favorite savo lot.,,
no anymore.,,
service went down.,,
closing time is 10 pm and now it's 9:35 and they already closed.,,
closed 25 minutes before the closing time and the staff didn't even want to look towards the door to explain to us why they closing soon,,
awful.,,
with so many other supermarkets in a close local.,,
this store is unnecessary.,,
the items i went there to obtain.,,
are no longer available.,,
( chicken and ribs bbq sauce.,,
brigs half smokes etc).,,
with the change in merchandise.,,
and the √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
upon entering the save-a-lot supermarket.,,
i noticed that the store appeared to relatively small according to similar save-a-lot stores i've visited in the past.,,
question why does the save a lot on mlk hwy in seat pleasant md doesn't sell marinade sauce?,,
great prices for certain things.,,
food dessert location,,
i give it three and a half stars.room for improvements.,,
"over all great job""",,
i love to shop where i can find what i want...,,
great prices and most of the staff was friendly.,,
pleasant staff.,,
the price is okay dokey √∞√øÀú≈°,,
it was pleasent,,
my son dropped my eggs rite out side door they made me buy more,,
if you're on a very tight budget or you just want to get more bang for your buck this is the gun for you my favorite one is located off of chillum road check it out check it out check it out it's also really great for last minute shopping √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great place low prices,,

limited selection.,,
welcome to the food desert.,,
just need more choices,,
worse store,,
it's pretty because is a big place for people.,,
shelves are bare.,,
lines are long.,,
good customer service management does a great job,,
not large enough.,,
the only grocery store in the immediate area...older building...needs work...meats are sketchy...i wouldn't recommend buying meats...everything else is okay...off brands sold here,,
manager not customer oriented.,,
located in a low income area and management treat it's customers as such.,,
never enough registers open.,,
worst save a lot n history i will never shop here,,
affordable grocery and produce,,
they have good services,,
it's ok to shop close to home most of the time they only have one register open and the rest of the workers or management stand around and look stupid and don't help.,,
too many people hanging out around store..,,
nice place to shop,,
it's good,,
good for basic items.,,

now this is an experience.,,
i shopped in the one in new orleans several times.,,
i am delighted to find it in alexandria.,,
the butcher was awesome and went above and beyond!,,
love it and can not wait to go back.,,
the deli has a nice selection as does the bulk aisle.,,
very nice wine department.,,
helpful and knowledgeable.,,
good place to pick up nibbles to bring to a party.,,
tempting array of bulk candy and baked goods.,,
specialty items like fancy pop-up greeting cards.,,
excellent service.,,
brands you never see in conventional grocery stores.,,
lots of delicious looking items.,,
kind of like a whole foods.,,
without the big selection.,,
prices are higher than safeway and inventory is limited.,,
they do have a few limited items you won't find in your typical supermarket.,,
wine is readily available.,,
they also have single chicken breasts bone in and boneless.,,
good cheesecake frozen not made in store.,,
"staff needs work..
not sure how to reply so edit works...
because the cheesecake is frozen and sipped in and sitting in the freezer staff that is working in the bakery should't use ""the person that √¢‚Ç¨¬¶",,
a little expensive but i guess you get what you pay for.,,
i'm really bummed though.,,
i'm traveling and forgot my toothpaste.,,
no such luck.,,
what grocery store dosen't carry toothpaste?,,
awesome place to shop.,,
friendly staff.. very polite throughout my experience.,,
will be going back soon.,,
the selection of food just isn't what it used to be.,,
and there's far more pre-made.,,
this location wasn't the √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
looks like a mini whole foods.,,
good food and salad varieties.,,
good whole grilled chicken.,,
also they have this roll with rosemary and sea salt that tastes great.,,
my favorite.,,
upscale specialty market with sometimes  surprisingly good prices on specials and even some everyday items.,,
good selection of gourmet foods.,,
easily seen from the road.,,
they stock a huge variety of goods and the place is wonderfully arranged.,,
the customer service is also great!,,
i absolutely love this store!,,
the little big meal is an amazing bargain.,,
their usda prime steaks are a steal when they go on sale.,,
as well as the deli salads.,,
even though some items may be a bit steep.,,
the deals are great.,,
no help.,,
i went in for special ingredients for an italian recipe.,,
they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have shallots.,,
i asked for help identifying a specific kind of olive which their sign said they had and an employee said √¢‚Ç¨Àúoh our manager just quit and she used to √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
friendly and knowledgeable staff that answered my incessant questions of why and where and what is this?,,
great selection of products and readymade meals.,,
their cakes are beautiful and taste great!,,
we go there for everyone's birthday cake!,,
wonderful place to shop!,,
very good selection of stuff.,,
its like a mini whole foods.,,
but with fewer selections.,,
bakery is a must try.,,
my favorite grocer in the area bar none.,,
well stocked and displayed.,,
i really wish more places treated you like this.,,
such a disappointment.,,
but i have visited this particular store 4 times now and wasn't happy.,,
the staff in both the meat department and the deli department were rude.,,
great place for one off healthy grocery needs but cost a bit more for everyday goods.,,
great meat and seafood counter.,,
excellent cheese choices.,,
these people are scammers .i recommended you to check each and staffs you grabbed  before you leave the store.,,
the fish is still good and the veggies are good too.,,
but the prices on some of the fruit are √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
not cheap though.,,
great bakery section and prepared food items.,,
not alot of vegetarian options in the prepared food area.,,
definitely not the place for everyday shopping.,,
i absolutely love this store and would give it 5 stars if not for one thing.,,
smokers.,,
they have a small patio outside.,,
which is filled with their staff smoking cigarettes.,,
which not only keeps people from eating outside but it's gross when you're walking in the door.,,
has everything i need including my hair dye & dark chocolate malts balls √∞√øÀú¬ç,,
they have some high end products which are very good.,,
some of my favorites are mocha granola.,,
cannoli and plantain chips.,,
they're better than any other places.,,
.. they lack some products.,,
it's not just a general grocery store.,,
they dont have a variety of shampoo and this kind of stuff.,,
variety appetizers.,,
savory gourmet.,,
specialty cuisine and imports,,
this is a very good specialty food store,,
healthy selections.,,
but overpriced.,,
pricey and great location,,
beautiful gourmet market with excellent meat and fish counters.,,
flowers.,,
delicious sandwiches and sushi.,,
bulk coffee and candy.,,
spices and baking.,,
and wine and beer.,,
very good sale prices on boneless chicken breasts.,,
fruit.,,
i now find myself wanting to go here than the store that literally around the corner from my house.,,
everything is just so much better.,,
i'm really happy to have found them.,,
nice for occasional shopping.,,
they have gourmet items.,,
lots of in-store prepared hot and cold foods.,,
and items i can't find anywhere else.,,
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an active store employee.,,
this store is very racist!,,
there is no equal opportunity & management only care about their own selves.,,
people of my skin color don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get opportunities to go to other departments & learn new things.,,
when i ask √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
it's not cheap but everything is good.,,
the lady who makes the sushi is amazing,,
i prefer to do my quotidian shopping elsewhere as things here tend to be more expensive than at the nearby safeway.,,
fancy cheeses.,,
and a good assortment of rarer ingredients.,,
i'd never visited before and was quite pleased at the selection of healthy and tasty products.,,
nice local grocery store.,,
lots of organic sat decent prices.,,
they offer specials.,,
like chicken for $2.99/lb on tuesdays.,,
the staff is also very courteous and attentive.,,
great for those special things a recipe calls for or last minute add one to a meal or a ready made meal.,,
a little pricey.,,
we love this place.,,
contrary to some of the other reviews.,,
i'd say the prices are pretty normal for a nice no.,,
va supermarket ( but *less* than whole foods.,,
in my experience).,,
the produce is beautiful with a pretty decent selection of √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
very good and needed addition to the bradlee shopping experience.,,
i think i'm in love.,,
this place is not spendy.,,
compared to any stores in dc proper.,,
the variety of products is not astonishing.,,
but it's ample.,,
and it lives up to its name.,,
i like the classical music which plays over the pa system.,,
will come back!,,
i've been to many different ones and the produce.,,
meal deals and everything are top notch.,,
.. the meat counter at the alexandria store is disappointing.,,
not because of the quantity.,,
but rather the √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
they could use more lighting inside.,,
a bit dark.,,
loved shopping here.,,
so much to offer.,,
amazing meat and seafood.,,
great boutique grocer.,,
excellent produce options.,,
nice wine and beer selection.,,
overpriced.,,
difficult to check out.,,
staff not particularly friendly or helpful.,,
bought a ny strip steak on sale for a great price here and it was delicious√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùnotably  superior to what we have bought at more expensive places like whole foods.,,
high-end market with a nice selection of prepared food.,,
not inexpensive.,,
similar to other high end grocery stores with lots of specialty and prepared items.,,
but nice if that is the experience you are after.,,
love their weekly meal kits!,,
everything delicious for one great price!,,
great produce and meat.,,
lots of gluten free selection.,,
relaxed shopping environment with nice classical music.,,
what's not to love.,,
very great service and food.,,
very nice upscale supermarket.,,
fantastic prepared food.,,
especially the sushi,,
some of the items are more expensive than other major grocery stores and some of them are less.,,
hot food bars good.,,
good rotisserie.,,
fairly good produce.,,
also great sushi.,,
so much potential here.,,
grocery items.,,
prepped food.,,
the customer service is what keeps my rating down at only three stars.,,
people on the √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
lovely little grocery store.,,
good alternative to wegmans.,,
bulk nuts... can't find that everywhere.,,
like all grocery markets.,,
you just need to keep an eye on their ads to know when to get the best prices.,,
love this place!,,
i ordered a brie and ham panini and fell in love.,,
i literally groaned when i at this.,,
they have caramelized onions on it that added a delicate sweetness.,,
it was a fabulous sandwich and not just because i was hungry.,,
they √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
recently each time i've come i've had to watch because the discounts offered are not accurately reflected at the register.,,
and each time.,,
it is errors on the store's signage or poor displays (putting flavors not on sale in the sale √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
fine store,,
love this place,,
great selection of things!,,
sushi.,,
and wines!,,
also super friendly stuff.,,
also carry gluten free & have a great selection of produce & premade foods.,,
good competitor to whole foods with cheaper prices.,,
decent food for the price.,,
it's not whole foods but it's better than most grocery stores.,,
big perk is their butcher shop and meat sales on tuesdays.,,
worth a look of you are in search of a new grocery store,,
good selection of organic and conventional goods.,,
the baked goods are fantastic and the meats are reasonably priced and very good.,,
they had my beet puffs!!,,
excellent bakery.,,
dark and moody.,,
it would not hurt to use high wattage bulbs so customers could actually see,,
horrible cashier.,,
i was there on 8/23/2017 around 8pm and the cashier would not give me a receipt.,,
she stated that i chose the email receipt button.,,
when in fact it did not even appear.,,
so lets just say that i did hit that button... am i √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
3 timed went in for crumpets.,,
they did not have,,
cozy and great local market,,
prices are comparable to whole foods.,,
but you get what you pay for.,,
"i love they're ""little big meals"" that have all the fixins to put together a home cooked meal for a reasonable price.",,
the savvy shoppers will find the weekly specials can be a great buy.,,
you can find meats not available at other stores.,,
the downside is their prices.,,
herbed potato salad and some melon.,,
the produce is nice.,,
check out is efficient but the help in the store.,,
at fish and meat departments is abysmal.,,
i used it to pick √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
very helpful and knowledgeable staff keeps us coming back,,
i was comparing but found the frozen and dairy section  limited.,,
i di think the produce was above average.,,
best bakery of all the local grocery stores.,,
upscale grocery store.,,
i did try it more than dozen times across last  year since i moved to alexandria.,,
i stopped going there while ago.,,
but my husband pick up some chicken there yesterday... today's √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
nice upscale grocery store.,,
you can't get french roast coffee in decaf anywhere.,,
including kona & french roast in decaf.,,
they are delicious!,,
first came across this market while in richmond.,,
va. staff was very friendly on my visit.,,
.. in past 6 months customer service is deteriating.,,
prices are higher than whole foods and customer service not as good as giant.,,
or √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i love coming here.,,
an upscale market indeed.,,
i like the spacious set up and i do find items there i can not get anywhere else.,,
i deducted one star for 2 reasons.,,
the first is the staff is not very knowledgeable about the items they carry and 2nd i can not get sone of the special meat items from the butcher there.,,
great wine selection but mediocre with regard to beer.,,
fantastic deli counter and butcher.,,
good produce and meat selection and.... the only place that carries intelligentsia coffee!,,
relaxing shopping experience.,,
deli needs work,,
didn't really get a chance to survey the whole store.,,
excellent meat and produce.,,
pricey.,,
but worth it.,,
staff is very good.,,
layout confusing.,,
quiet.,,
welcoming.,,
the staff is very nice.,,
we like the store for the hard to fine brands and the dessert counter,,
dried fruit.,,
nuts.,,
and yogurt leave it more a niche marketplace fkr those who can't live without the latest quinoa salad craze.,,
wonderful place to shop,,
best supermarket on the entire planet!,,

the bakery operation is awesome and amazing.,,
and not only that.,,
every single thing tastes awesome.,,

the seafood/prepared foods employees were doing a group stretch before their shifts started on a saturday morning.,,

gourmet foods and a variety of organic and specialty items.,,

wegmans is awesome!,,
so glad centreville finally has this store!,,
great selection and much.,,
much better than our local giant store!,,
excellent shopping.,,
nice.,,
well laid out store with lot of variety,,
i wish i remember the name of our cashier so she could get a shout out but we left our baguette on the counter and she caught us before walking out the door to give us our bread!,,
very pleased with wegmans cashiers being trained to go out of the way for customers even at a very busy rush hour time.,,
:) (op# on receipt has 368683),,
great place to grab some food and enjoy it in the sitting area.,,
also a nice place for small group meetings and such.,,
overall the place offers a soothing ambiance.,,
this store is such a great one stop shop.,,
from the bakery.,,
prices are great and the service is stellar.,,

don't forget their √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
easy to navigate store and very friendly staff.,,
10/10x's i find what i need.,,
the little carts really help too.,,
you gotta see for yourself.,,
if you have not been to wegmans your missing out!,,
wegmans is what every grocery strives to be.,,
even if it's up to 9 miles away.,,
staff and store is the best.,,
had a vehicle being worked on across the street so i walked over for lunch.,,
had sushi.,,
soup and salad.,,
2fo staff need to be more swift in wrapping the orders.,,
wegmans has it all though a little more vegan selection would be great.,,
the time i went there.,,
the store was very crowned.,,
but maybe it's because its near dc.,,
i was able to purchase some beautiful roses.,,
the lady at the flower shop was helpful and kind.,,
she was able to assemble my roses into a beautiful √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i ordered a cake online made a mistake.,,
called wegmans and spoke with nancy she helped me out asked me to email my changes and called me back to confirm the order had been amended.,,
i am sure she was already very busy but she was fantastic and made my party preparations a whole lot easier.,,
thank you nancy!,,
a very nice place to shop.,,
this make it easier to find your car.,,
also a excellent section of food.,,
this place is amazing.,,

great place to shop.,,
all grocery stores should be this good.,,
their health food section is particularly impressive.,,
i hope they continue expanding to more locations.,,
great memories.,,
love the cat,,
quite possibly my all-time favorite supermarket!,,
the place is very lively.,,
and the cafeteria area makes you feel quite at home.,,
i come here at least once a week.,,
and the cashiers are very friendly.,,
and fairly easy to find unless they are running a special on it.,,
which means it can sometimes be challenging to find since it'll be on a new display.,,
the employees are friendly and helpful.,,
just wish it was open 24 hours.,,
the best grocery experience of all time!,,
love wegmans.,,
good selections.,,
also enjoy their buffet and eating area.,,
only issue is with the signs for each isle.,,
can only read them when in the isle.,,
but not when in the crossover lanes.,,
avoid peak times.,,
my all time favorite store.,,
we love wegman's.,,
the staff are very friendly.,,
they have great meat and produce.,,
a wonderful selection of gluten free goods.,,
if you think you will be a regular (or even semi-regular).,,
download the app.,,
you can choose your location and set up your shopping list based on the availability at that store.,,
the best part.,,
it gives you the aisle numbers to find what √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
wonderful store.,,
fine but definitely not ecology minded sooo much plastics packaging's,,
great selection of ice creams with holiday flavors.,,
very nice asian selection.,,
they stock angelo pietro salad dressings in the asian section.,,
i enjoy having lunch there.,,
plenty of variety to choose from.,,
nice and friendly staff.,,
the selection of prepared foods is great.,,
and i like the upstairs seating area at the wegmans in fairfax.,,
we just had a wonderful lunch after church with family and friends.,,
who would not love this place.,,
a bit spendy.,,
but you can get whatever you need.,,
i love the prepared meals and the large variety of cheeses.,,
had their overpriced sushi and the rice was dry.,,
i loved this market,,
some items are as competitive as costco.,,
this is the place.,,
just be careful with the pre-made take home food.,,
i spend $30 just on myself many times.,,
but i have only one issue.,,
when you took away the wine cellar and moved the wine&beer section to the first floor i was shocked.,,
the ambiance of the wine/beer cellar was awesome.,,
it really  set the tone for the store.,,
i really  miss it.,,
as expected.,,
a great -- if potentially overwhelming -- grocery experience.,,
even at peak times.,,
the store team does a great job of keeping everything moving.,,
know that the store is huge.,,
with many different sections (prepared foods.,,
very popular.,,
can be hard to move around store with cart.,,
but totally worth it.,,
c'mon.,,
it's wegmans.,,
what more do you need to know.,,
they really do work to make it right.,,
great grocery store.,,
from organic to all the regular basic groceries.,,
great wine selection.,,
so you may have to walk a little.,,
drugs.,,
restaurant.,,
etc.,,
check out isles are too narrow for customers to unload top and bottom or cart for cashier.,,
disabled customers trying to go through checkout isles do not have space they need for.,,
walker.,,
cane.,,
wheelchair.,,
crutches.,,
service dog.,,
handicap √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
the best supermarket in the nation.,,
great place for groceries and more.,,
too busy.,,
too small but great variety of food.,,
it's big.,,
and it's family owned.,,
i go here all the time and if you buy the wegmans.,,
you can get decent deals.,,
especially if you have one of their rewards cards,,
friendly place.,,
many good products.,,
prepared food hot bar has grilled chicken.,,
several kinds of noodles.,,
and salmon.,,
good seasonal fruits.,,
it is a fun place to move around the store.,,
amazing!,,
chen was the fastest cashier that day when i saw him.,,
he scans so fast it was like my eyes were aliasing and saw 4 hands!,,
he aslo helped me get a cart once while he was pushing them back in to the store.,,
he is the hardest working man i've ever seen!,,
phenomenal.,,
came when visiting family.,,
wish we had one where i live.,,
this supermarket never disappoints me.,,
i just love it.,,
i can't talk enough about how much i love this place.,,
i can spend over two hours in it.,,
between extra ordinary veggies and fruits.,,
and baked goods with most care and sincerely decorated cookies and cakes.,,
very good expericience.,,
was my first visit.,,
love this wegman's!,,
product prices display are very confusing.,,
looks intentional specially around bakery section.,,
set of cookies marked $7.99 at register it was 10.99.  informed the person at check out.she couldn't help.,,
cake packing was much to desire.,,
it √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
love love love.,,
my reward after my workout.,,
great veggies!,,
great employees!,,
i had a great time enjoyed coffee and bakery for breakfast.,,
this place is awesome!,,
the pies are baked with love go get you some.,,
the staff are friendly and helpful.,,
one of my favorite grocery stores.,,
i'm glad it's so close to my house.,,
i recommend trying wegmans.,,
a huge and fantastic supermarket!,,
they've got lots of things you won't find in other supermarkets.,,
i love the variety.,,
excellent food store with wide selections of brands and products,,
"update - refund was issued 

instacart is a total joke.",,
i was overcharged and did not get what i ordered.,,
i love wegmans so much!,,
wilmington.,,
nc desperately needs a wegmans!,,
(especially during non-peak hours),,
i don't usually shop at this location.,,
but i was in the area.,,
i love the produce section.,,
floral dept and breads.,,
oh man the deli is so good.,,
i love wegmans  and not because they originated in the same place i was born.,,
i have actually research wegmans and learned so much about the family and the way that they conduct business.,,
i must say.,,
i was extremely impressed.,,
so much so.,,
good over all store!,,
very busy the make lots of money.,,
the cashiers and even the employees are just friendly overall but really dont listen to what you say but they are friendly.,,
best grocery store.their store brand is awesome,,
i absolutely love wegmans.,,
now this location has just too many cons to be considered my favorite grocer.,,
the associates are constantly rude and dismissive.,,
in the evening the managers in charge act like unsupervised children and i find it √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
but my wife just bought home two platters of deli sandwiches for a reception we are hosting this afternoon.,,
and.,,
unbelievably.,,
the sandwiches have no toothpicks to hold them together!,,
so.,,
along with √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
has everything you would expect from a grocery store and more.,,
fast and friendly cashiers.,,
well thought out layout.,,
very helpful and friendly staff.,,
an epic.,,
palatial temple to food that is more than worth your time and your dollars.,,
best place on planet earth!!,,
don't waste time going to whole foods.,,
it was good.,,
i didn't think they had as good of selection on some stuff but they did have a nice variety.,,
great store to get everything,,
good selection of foods like meat bread and stuff while stuff could be overpriced some stuff are just fine,,
great place but hot food tables needed attention,,
"""compressed"" wegmans.",,
store was designed to have the wine section downstairs.,,
i guess the wine was not selling enough so they closed the downstairs and moved everything to the main floor.,,
"they achieved this by ""compressing"" all isles.",,
absolutely spotless store.,,
customer service is top notch here.,,
i had an issue once with something and a shift manager rearranged his staff to assist us.,,
wegmans produce is the best around.,,
everyone is very knowledgeable in many areas.,,
helpful.,,
and fast.,,
a great supermarket with great staff and options.,,
they have some international things too.,,
great place to shop,,
thanks to customer service special thanks to jim in nature market area he was so helpful and very professional,,
it's pretty pricey.,,
wegmans has went down hill in the last few years.,,
their produce clearly sits in a warehouse.,,
the staff is rude and unhelpful.,,
they never know where anything is and won't try to find out.,,
exceptional store.,,
great location and easy to navigate layout.,,
they can even make a custom pizza for you and have it ready when you are finished shopping.,,
the pizza is quite appetizing.,,
and i would highly recommend it.,,
value.,,
and a good experience.,,
wegman's is by far my favorite grocery store.,,
there's everything right there.,,
lots of prepared dishes ready to cook; great fruit and produce; meats and fish.,,
it is a very large store so it's best to acquaint yourself as to where where √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
must admit this was my first time here.,,
and i am happy to share with you that it wasn't the last.,,
pricing lower than most.,,
even got here coffee that i usually need to drive just to get it.,,
that was a great thing.,,
as a transplant from upstate ny myself.,,
grocery shopping in this area was so depressing before wegmans came to town and set the new expectations for grocery store selection.,,
and employee satisfaction.,,
there's no silly gas rewards bs either!,,
their produce.,,
meat and cheese selection is the best in the area.,,
friendly and knowledgeable staff.,,
great customer service along with good prices.,,
no matter which one you go to.,,
and as for products.,,
they pretty much have everything that you could possibly be looking for.,,
their prices √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
i could spend hours in this store!,,
the meat and seafood department is amazing.,,
i do wish they had a little more coupons.. that would set this place over the top.,,
great priced products that are really well done.,,
most of the products are store branded.,,
since this is a special store.,,
i can't imagine a time without coming here as it is the best.,,
and only the best!,,
busy as usual.,,
wanted to get some chocolate cookies.,,
then i saw a fly hovering and landed.,,
changed my mind on that.,,
wanted to get some cuban crispy pork and that section was empty.,,
oh well.,,
my favourite grocery store.,,
everything is top notch.,,
wegmans brand is often better than name brands.,,
love the sushi!,,
love the staff including marie and vicky at the food center.,,
great prices and convenient.,,
this wegman's hardly ever disappoints me.,,
they keep a stock of each item popular to their store.,,
if something is sold out one day on my return (without inquiring) the next day the item is there fully stocked.,,
i love this store!,,
finally found it!√∞√ø‚Äò≈ì√∞√ø¬§‚Äî after shopping at five other grocery stores.,,
i walked into this incredible place and left 11/2 hours later.,,
i found everything i needed and then some.,,
wow!,,
from now on.,,
the place for me.,,
picked up some nice halibut filets.,,
they took the skin off for me.,,
my daughter and i made ceviche that was excellent.,,
their bakery is great too.,,
i can't resist their muffins.,,
they also have a wide variety of items at their self service bars.,,
as well as a sub shop and pizza.,,
their pizza is the closest to ny that √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
great produce both organic or not plus local or not.,,
love.,,
love their black cherry vanilla sparkling water!,,
there has to be something you can eat here no matter what diet you're on!,,
it's a nice wegmans if wegmans is what you're looking for.,,
there are lots of fancy things to choose from but you will spend double what you would in a typical grocery store.,,
there are some items that are comparable but if you are a bargain √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
stopped in for the first time.,,
was expecting the prices to be on level of whole foods but pleasantly surprised prices were reasonable.,,
a worker (katie) even checked the back for an out of stock item for me.,,
great food court.,,
100% recommended!,,
wegmans is the best supermarket i have ever been shopping at.,,
beautiful.,,
and well laid out store.,,
employee's are all so friendly and helpful.,,

people are friendly.,,
checkout is fast.,,
the store has a wide selection of items.,,
the checkout lines are monitored and if they get too long.,,
they open another register.,,
the prices are good for groceries but their food to go that you weigh are too pricey.,,
even the bakery items like sugar cookies are sold by weight.,,
i think like $9/lb.,,
wegman's has it all!,,
i went there for their delicious hot cheese!,,
jalapeno cayenne cheddar.,,
friggin awesome.,,
i love hot.,,

the bakery is outstanding.,,
try the rosemary sour dough and the garlic tuscan bread.,,
the deserts are lovely.,,
but again.,,
very good though.,,
instacart is turning wegmans from a 5 star experience to eventually less than 3 stars.,,
many of the instacart independent contractors batch together multiple orders.,,
if the orders are small enough.,,
they will use an express lane cashier  (15 √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
this location is well organized.,,
fully staffed.,,
and their customer service is implacable.,,

it's a very fantastic store bigger than i thought.,,
tasty food.,,
check out clerk needs to be taught how to talk courteously.,,
nothing below 4 dollars.,,
one of the best grocery stores to buy food.,,
i have heard from others that items are  expensive.,,
well in my opinion staples are affordable than most grocery stores around montgomery county.,,
i have compiled a list of prices.,,
examples are √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
they usually have everything that i'm looking for.,,
the employees are courteous and helpful.,,
and they offer hot and cold buffet items and 4 themed dining areas:  patio.,,

love wagemans,,
definitely on the expensive side.,,
i shop here for my groceries also and they have a wide selection of gluten free products.,,
i especially love the muffins in their basket section.,,
even though we don't live particularly close to wegmans.,,
we seriously consider driving 20+ minutes more than normal to shop there.,,
in particular.,,
cashiers vary greatly.,,
friendly and helpful employees and excellent selection.,,
everything is good here except there were no cashier lanes with 15/20 items lanecopen today on a busy day - father's day.,,
very cool store!,,
wish we had one in hagerstown!,,
i love this wegmans i can find bill gray's sauce and country sweet here!,,

all you see is empty shelves.,,
awesome grocery store.,,
a wide selection of everthing pertaining to food.,,
store is large.,,
has a wide variety of products.,,
many specially items that you will not find that other supermarkets in the germantown area.,,
wegmans now have renewable plastic bags.,,

their dining area is neat.,,
accessible and kids friendly.,,
oh and dont forget to bring your wallet,,
found what was needed.,,
except pine nuts!,,
bottle of goya hot sauce was available only in small size.,,
but will do.,,
we love wegmans.,,

what a phenomenal store.,,
as someone who is a chef and a foodie.,,
this place is a veritable playground!,,
we lost an hour just exploring the soaps.,,
cheeses and ethnic foods!,,
the staff was pleasant and helpful and made us feel appreciated.,,
can't wait to go back and explore some more.,,
this store has everyrhing!,,
it is so large i had trouble finding all of the items on my shopping list.,,
fortunately.,,
the employees are very nice and helpful and i finally found everything.,,
i don't think it's possible to love a grocery store more!!!,,
fantastic inventory.,,
i never pick up anything out of date.,,
to cookies and cakes.,,
to a variety of √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
haven't been in a wegmans in years.,,
it was way better than i remembered.,,
catering was fantastic for my daughter's graduation party.,,
wide selection.,,
worth the drive from bethesda.,,
best produce than anywhere!,,
the employees there were helpful and helping me with putting my groceries into my cart for me.,,
my kids had to use the bathroom and the guy was nice enough to wait for us to go in and be done.,,
such patient employees there.,,
i love wegmans!,,
cheese train!,,
was very excited to see that wegmans had finally made it to the area.,,
love their self-serve bulk products areas.,,
their great variety.,,
and their plentiful wegmans-brand selection.,,
very impressed its like a few grocery stores in one.,,
different departments all with people ready to serve.,,
it's like a small costco meets shoppers meets what they have a train on the ceiling oh my barrels with candies and seasoning etc.,,
the meat selection the sushi selection awesome,,
18-inch pizza for $10!,,
wonderful grocery store.,,
one of the best grocery stores in the area.,,

something for everyone!,,
a good grocery store with variety,,
love the frozen cod.,,
salmon and flounder,,

excellent product selections.,,

i hope √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
beautiful store.,,
very cozy.,,
very well designed.,,
great place to meet someone for business as well as an excellent selection of groceries at a fair price.,,
you would expect the place to be restocked before a weekend.,,
not a frozen rasberry to be seen.,,
a lot of shelves partially empty.,,
items they used to carry are no longer available.,,
used to be a great store.,,
but seems to be going downhill,,
it is one of my most favorite places to visit when i visit my grandchildren √∞√øÀú≈°!,,
i  just love to shop in wegmans√¢¬ù¬§!!,,
the cashiers were great but we love amal and mary the most,,
this market has good meat and liquor .,,
i come here every now and then when i go to walmart around the corner to but my meat.,,
their prepared meals are tasty and time saving.,,
absolute pleasure!,,
what a treat to visit a store with deep selection and kind service.,,
shout out to a young man in bakery who worked on september 5th at 12:30pm.,,
he had made my day!,,
wegmans is absolutely the best supermarket chain in the usa!,,
fantastic variety of all foods..great selection of nonfood items and wonderful selection of wines..prixes are good.,,
you must visit their cheese and bread departments...fantastic!!,,
this is both one of my favorite grocery stores and among the most dreaded.,,
"""why?""",,
you might ask.,,
well.,,
it's not just how extensive their selection is.,,
wegmans is the best grocery store in the area.,,
make sure you install the app!,,
the app also organizes your shopping list by aisle in the store.,,
if you haven't been.,,
you haven't lived.,,
everybody's got their favorites.,,
publix.,,
h. e. b.. harris teeter.,,
wegmans has great prepared foods.,,

i find more than what i need.,,
superb store.,,

i have been going to the wegmans near leesburg for years and love the experience.,,
first time to this location and all i can say is holy cow!,,
what a big store.,,
and the cafe is huge with an amazing selection.,,
this is a very good location like most are.,,
great place to find everything on your grocery list.,,
and delicious already made food.,,
in store best baked breads.,,
cakes and european style desserts.,,
associates are so helpful and friendly no matter when i go.,,
my go to store for gourmet cheeses.,,
wine and special veggies.√∞√ø‚Äô≈ì,,
only thing that prevents me from shopping there all the time is distance from home and price.,,
they also have free snacks/cookies which my girls take each time when leaving.,,
i've come to love this place- my husband too.,,
grocery store.,,
my children love coming here!,,
the train over the milk section.,,
this is a great very busy location.,,
i go to this wegmans on occasion.,,
the store is laid out a bit weird in terms of the grocery aisles.,,
but other than that no complaints.,,
they have a huge beer / wine √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
wegmans is a great store to do your shopping for things that you can't find elsewhere.,,
it has a fabulous food bar with just about any type of food you would want.,,
i don't know what the price per pound is.,,
but it's very easy to rack up a √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
one of the best grocery stores i've ever been to.,,
high priced low nutrition salad bar for vegetarians.,,
we found everything on our list.,,
good place to get great specialty as well as common groceries.,,
i love the smoked salmon!,,
great selection of products.,,
not only do they have hard to find products they have reasonable prices on family packs.,,
i love wegs... best grocery shopping.,,
great wine selection... what's not to love?,,
good grocery store with an extensive selection of produce.,,

bit the best combination of price and selection.,,
have zero complaints about food but occasionally the staff seem upset and it reflects on service but overall really great experiences,,
i had the best sandwich of my life (so far) here!,,
the key negative i'm going to get out of the way.,,
you go at a regular peak time and you'll find yourself an analog for dc rush hour (at least it's not fury road.,,
go to costco if you want that experience).,,
i love there samples & huge variety.,,
never disappoints.,,
we don't really shop for groceries.,,
we like the hot food section.,,
it's really nice to have the gourmet food.,,
restaurants.,,
and food bar.,,
like getting the new mexico hatch chiles in the fall.,,
i shop here mainly for the produce.,,
definitely download their app and make a list before going.,,
by having a list with their app you will find things easier and it will save you so much time.,,
my favorite wegmans in the area.,,
friendly employees.,,
there are some items i know i can get for about half the price elsewhere but for the most part the prices are fantastic!,,
the assortment of cheese is a plus as well.,,
even get our flu shots and ez pass their.,,
just a very convenient.,,
and organized place.,,
this wegmans is great for both grocery shopping and take out.,,
i especially enjoy their sushi and hot bar.,,
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tried the new mexican bar yet.,,
good selection and prices lower than ht on many things we buy.,,
get our fish here.,,
a very nice place for your groceries and quite reasonable prices.,,
it has food selections from different parts of the world.,,
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cheese section is especially outstanding.,,
produce department in fairfax.,,
va store was disappointing.,,
multiple instances of produce on the floor.,,
very dangerous.,,
i slipped and went down!,,
very lucky i wasn't hurt.,,
labor machines out of stickers consistently.,,
it is.,,
and has been.,,
one of the finest supermarkets in the us for many years.,,
it's huge.,,
has everything you need.,,
but at reasonable prices.,,
they sell black truffles at $999.00 per pound.,,
but they also sell standard items you would find at any market in america like cheerios.,,
twinkies.,,
keebler cookies.,,
interesting food.,,
and helpful staff,,
the sterling wegmans is good.,,
hot food bar is solid and delicious.,,
pizza/soup-and-sandwich/amerimex-station deals are better bang for your buck.,,
but all options are great for lunch.,,
grocery is decently priced with a solid house brand.,,
a welcome sight when i first moved to the area.,,
wonderful store love to see one open in rockville,,
the best grocery store in america!,,
great store with a wide selection of prepared foods.,,
this is one of the most unique grocery shopping experiences in the area by far.,,
the prepared food is wonderful and there's also a small √¢‚Ç¨¬¶,,
went in for a salad and fruit.,,
great salad.,,
wegmans is the grocery store standard.,,
their prices.,,
selection.,,
as is their store brand items.,,
i find the app very helpful in locating items and planning meals for the week.,,
